## Phase 1: Parse Subcommand / 第 1 阶段：解析子命令

Determine the mode from the argument:

- `scan` — Scan the codebase for tech debt indicators / 扫描代码库以查找技术债务指标
- `add` — Add a new tech debt entry manually / 手动添加新技术债务条目
- `prioritize` — Re-prioritize the existing debt register / 重新优先排序现有债务登记册
- `report` — Generate a summary report of current debt status / 生成当前债务状态摘要报告

If no subcommand is provided, output usage and stop. Verdict: **FAIL** — missing required subcommand. / 如果未提供子命令，输出用法并停止。裁决：**FAIL** — 缺少必需子命令。

---

## Phase 2A: Scan Mode

Search the codebase for debt indicators:

- `TODO` comments (count and categorize)
- `FIXME` comments (these are bugs disguised as debt)
- `HACK` comments (workarounds that need proper solutions)
- `@deprecated` markers
- Duplicated code blocks (similar patterns in multiple files)
- Files over 500 lines (potential god objects)
- Functions over 50 lines (potential complexity)

Categorize each finding:

- **Architecture Debt**: Wrong abstractions, missing patterns, coupling issues
- **Code Quality Debt**: Duplication, complexity, naming, missing types
- **Test Debt**: Missing tests, flaky tests, untested edge cases
- **Documentation Debt**: Missing docs, outdated docs, undocumented APIs
- **Dependency Debt**: Outdated packages, deprecated APIs, version conflicts
- **Performance Debt**: Known slow paths, unoptimized queries, memory issues

Present the findings to the user.

Ask: "May I write these findings to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"

If yes, update the register (append new entries, do not overwrite existing ones). Verdict: **COMPLETE** — scan findings written to register.

If no, stop here. Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.

---

## Phase 2B: Add Mode

Prompt for: description, category, affected files, estimated fix effort, impact if left unfixed.

Present the new entry to the user.

Ask: "May I append this entry to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"

If yes, append the entry. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — entry added to register.

If no, stop here. Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.

---

## Phase 2C: Prioritize Mode

Read the debt register at `docs/tech-debt-register.md`.

Score each item by: `(impact_if_unfixed × frequency_of_encounter) / fix_effort`

Re-sort the register by priority score and recommend which items to include in the next sprint.

Present the re-prioritized register to the user.

Ask: "May I write the re-prioritized register back to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"

If yes, write the updated file. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — register re-prioritized and saved.

If no, stop here. Verdict: **BLOCKED** — user declined write.

---

## Phase 2D: Report Mode

Read the debt register. Generate summary statistics:

- Total items by category
- Total estimated fix effort
- Items added vs resolved since last report
- Trending direction (growing / stable / shrinking)

Flag any items that have been in the register for more than 3 sprints.

Output the report to the user. This mode is read-only — no files are written. Verdict: **COMPLETE** — debt report generated.

---

## Phase 3: Next Steps

- Run `/sprint-plan` to schedule high-priority debt items into the next sprint.
- Run `/tech-debt report` at the start of each sprint to track debt trends over time.

### Debt Register Format

```markdown
## Technical Debt Register
Last updated: [Date]
Total items: [N] | Estimated total effort: [T-shirt sizes summed]

| ID | Category | Description | Files | Effort | Impact | Priority | Added | Sprint |
|----|----------|-------------|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| TD-001 | [Cat] | [Description] | [files] | [S/M/L/XL] | [Low/Med/High/Critical] | [Score] | [Date] | [Sprint to fix or "Backlog"] |
```

### Rules
- Tech debt is not inherently bad — it is a tool. The register tracks conscious decisions.
- Every debt entry must explain WHY it was accepted (deadline, prototype, missing info)
- "Scan" should run at least once per sprint to catch new debt
- Items older than 3 sprints without action should either be fixed or consciously accepted with a documented reason
